# Requirements

In addition to having a basic understanding of Linux and running commands from the terminal, this tutorial requires the following:

For the host system used to build the image:
- [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/) or later installed
- Internet connectivity
- 10GB of free storage space

For the public cloud that you want the image in:
````{tabs}

```{group-tab} AWS
- An existing AWS account
- [Credentials (key pairs and access keys)](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/aws/aws-how-to/instances/launch-ubuntu-ec2-instance/#setup-credentials)
```
```{group-tab} Azure

Content to be added
```

```{group-tab} GCP

-------  TODO: -----------------

Decide whether CLI needs to be added as a requirement for each of the clouds(AWS CLI, Azure CLI and gcloud). If launching from the GUI is possible, we could skip the requirement here and mention CLI as an option along with relevant pointers to public cloud docs. 

If CLI is the preferred option, then we need to decide if that is included as a requirement here or instructions for installing it are added where needed.

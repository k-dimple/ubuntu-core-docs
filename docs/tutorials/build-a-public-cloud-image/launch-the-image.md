## Connect to the device


Congratulations! You have successfully built your own image, installed it, and connected to Ubuntu Core on a public cloud.

----------- TODO: Change this to point to a new how-to-guide that is public cloud specific. In that guide, use some specific example (TBD) to show how one can experiment with the image. ----------

See [First steps with Ubuntu Core](/how-to-guides/using-ubuntu-core) for an introduction to using Ubuntu Core.

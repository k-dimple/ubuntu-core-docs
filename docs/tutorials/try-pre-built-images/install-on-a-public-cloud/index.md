# Install on a public cloud

We create pre-built Ubuntu Core images for several public clouds. Currently they are available for private preview in the respective marketplaces. These images are a way to explore Ubuntu Core.

* [Install on AWS](install-on-aws): Try Ubuntu Core on an AWS EC2 instance
* [Install on Azure](install-on-azure): Try Ubuntu Core on Azure
* [Install on GCP](install-on-gcp): Try Ubuntu Core on a GCE instance in Google cloud
* [Install on OpenStack](install-on-openstack): Try Ubuntu Core on an OpenStack instance

Canonical produces official images for the [following platforms](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/supported-platforms).

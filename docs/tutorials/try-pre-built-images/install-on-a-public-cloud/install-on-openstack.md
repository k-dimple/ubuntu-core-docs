# Install a pre-built Ubuntu Core image on an OpenStack instance

Pre-built images are ideal for exploration and experimentation of Ubuntu Core, but they are not intended for deployment or use at scale. 

You can find more information about building Core images for public clouds in the [Build a public cloud image](/tutorials/build-a-public-cloud-image/index) tutorial.


## Requirements

You will need:

- An existing OpenStack environment
- An [OpenStack RC file](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/user-guide/common/cli-set-environment-variables-using-openstack-rc.html) for the OpenStack instance
- An [OpenStack command-line client](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html)
- `qemu-utils`

## Setup

Install all the required packages (most of them should be already provided by your distribution):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget xz-utils openssh-client qemu-utils
````

Place your OpenStack RC file in a new directory for this project. Set up the credentials by sourcing the file. Assuming the file is called `PROJECT-openrc.sh`, run:

```bash
. PROJECT-openrc.sh
```
Download the Core image to be used and convert it to QCOW format so that it can be used with OpenStack:

```bash
wget https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/24/stable/current/ubuntu-core-24-amd64.img.xz
unxz ubuntu-core-24-amd64.img.xz
qemu-img convert -c -O qcow2 ubuntu-core-24-amd64.img core24.qcow
```

## Deploy to OpenStack

Start by registering the image with OpenStack using the client you set up in the [Requirements](#requirements) section:

```bash
openstack image create TEST-ubuntu-core24 --disk-format qcow2 --file core24.qcow --property hw_firmware_type=uefi --progress
```

Use the `keypair create` subcommand to generate a new SSH key pair and save a copy to the working directory. Test the key exists in our OpenStack instance with the `keypair list` subcommand:

```bash
openstack keypair create TEST-ubuntu-core > key.pem
openstack keypair list | grep TEST-ubuntu-core
```

Secure the private file key, since SSH will throw an error and ignore the key if its file permissions are too open. Set the permissions as read-only for the owner:

```bash
chmod 400 key.pem
```

Now launch the instance on OpenStack using the key pair:

```bash
openstack server create TEST-core --image TEST-ubuntu-core24 --flavor b2-7 --network Ext-Net --key-name TEST-ubuntu-core --config-drive true
```

You should shortly be able to see the instance using the `server list` subcommand:

```bash
openstack server list
```

Take note of the IP address from the `Networks` column of the output. It'll be a string of the form `01.234.567.89` seen after the `Ext-Net` value.

## Log in to the instance

Connect to the instance using the IP from the previous step:

```bash
ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@<instance_ip>
```

Congratulations! You have successfully launched an OpenStack instance with a pre-built Ubuntu Core image.

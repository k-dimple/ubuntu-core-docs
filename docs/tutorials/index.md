# Tutorials

This section of our documentation contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Ubuntu Core is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing Ubuntu Core or building a custom image for your device.

After you get Ubuntu Core up and running, take a look at our [First steps using Ubuntu Core](/how-to-guides/using-ubuntu-core) guide.

## Build an image

Ubuntu Core has been designed to facilitate the creation, deployment, and  management of secure custom images running on your own hardware. 


* [Build your first Ubuntu Core image](/tutorials/build-your-first-image/index):

  A step-by-step guide to building and testing your own image with your own selection of applications.

* [Build an Ubuntu Core image for public clouds](/tutorials/build-a-public-cloud-image/index):

  Build and test an Ubuntu Core image for different public clouds such as AWS, Azure and GCP.

## Install Ubuntu Core

Pre-built test images are also available for Renesas GZ/G2l and MediaTek Genio devices, alongside x86-based PC-style hardware and ARM-based platforms.


. These testing images are ideal for exploration  and experimentation but they're not intended for deployment or for use at scale.


* [Install and try a pre-built image](/tutorials/try-pre-built-images/index)

    Test a pre-built image within a VM, or by installing Ubuntu Core on specific hardware.

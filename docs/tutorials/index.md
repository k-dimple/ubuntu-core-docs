Ubuntu Core has been designed to facilitate the creation, deployment, and  management of secure custom images running on your own hardware or on any cloud platform.

This section of our documentation contains a step-by-step tutorial to help you build your own public cloud image using Ubuntu Core.


* [Build an Ubuntu Core image for public clouds](/tutorials/build-a-public-cloud-image/index):  Currently, instructions for three different public clouds are included - AWS, Azure and GCP.


After you get Ubuntu Core up and running, take a look at our [First steps using Ubuntu Core](/how-to-guides/using-ubuntu-core) guide.

# How-to guides

This section includes guides to help you with two main features:

## Try pre-built images

Pre-built Ubuntu Core images are available for private preview in the marketplaces of different public cloud platforms. Currently they are available on Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google cloud. A pre-built image for OpenStack is also available. 

They are ideal for exploration and experimentation, but they are not intended for deployment or use at scale.

* [Launch a pre-built image on AWS](launch-on-aws): Try Ubuntu Core on an AWS EC2 instance
* [Launch a pre-built image on Azure](launch-on-azure): Try Ubuntu Core on Azure
* [Launch a pre-built image on GCP](launch-on-gcp): Try Ubuntu Core on a GCE instance in Google cloud
* [Launch a pre-built image on OpenStack](launch-on-openstack): Try Ubuntu Core on an OpenStack instance


## How to use Ubuntu Core

While Ubuntu Core is primarily intended for developers to build custom images tailored for their application and targeted hardware, this page is a great place to start after you’ve just launched pre-built Ubuntu Core images and want to learn a few of the basic principles quickly.
